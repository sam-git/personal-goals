Bussed to Wellington where I stayed with Sarah and Gary who I hadn't seen for two years. Was good to catch up with them. I got them a bottle of wine each as a present and the guy in Liquorland where I bought them wrapped them up nicely in plastic and with a fancy bow for free.

Met up with Elliott who is visiting Wellington from the UK and hung out with his friend Johnny too. I took them to KK Malaysian which they both loved and agreed it was the best food they had had in Wellington (and also amazingly good value).

- Had breakfast out with Elliott and Johnny. Was feeling a bit hung over, but the waitress was really nice and friendly came and chatted with us for a bit. We left her a tip.
- Got all the way to the end of reading the chapter in Eloquent Javascript on Building a Programming Language. I found it tough going but it was rewarding to get to the end of it having understood everything.
- Went for a run in a park and my legs finally didn't hurt.

- Went to Oriental Bay with Sarah and her 2 kids before lunch time. The weather was amazing and it was really nice just relaxing on the beach.
- Was back at Mum's place in the evening and went swimming in the Pohangina River. I found all these deep pools and a place with a rea;ly strong current that would push you down the river. Was a good swim.
