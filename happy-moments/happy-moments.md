Bussed to Wellington where I stayed with Sarah and Gary who I hadn't seen for two years. Was good to catch up with them. I got them a bottle of wine each as a present and the guy in Liquorland where I bought them wrapped them up nicely in plastic and with a fancy bow for free.

- Had breakfast out with Elliott and Johnny. Was feeling a bit hung over, but the waitress was really nice and friendly came and chatted with us for a bit. We left her a tip.
- Got all the way to the end of reading the chapter in Eloquent Javascript on Building a Programming Language. I found it tough going but it was rewarding to get to the end of it having understood everything.
